# Learning Resources

This repository contains a number of resources for learning different topics in computer science. In particular, you will find resources on machine learning and how to contribute to open source projects, which formed a large part of my [Senior Independent Study Project](https://github.com/ndalton12/Python-Learning).

## General Computer Science Topics

Learning a new programming language or computer science topic can seem daunting at first, but there are numerous courses, books, and cheat-sheets available online to help you learn. The two best ways for me to learn were to read books, which demand your attention, and to actually just work on exercises. I also took an online course which relied on lecture videos, which provided a different learning experience, one that you may prefer.

Here are some links to get you started:

#### Quick References

1.  [Learn X in Y](https://learnxinyminutes.com/)

Learn X in Y is a website for learning different programming languages (and even a few CS topics) in a short timeframe. The languages are presented directly as code, with increasingly complex topics. This website is especially good if you are already comfortable with programming, but want to dive into a new language as quick as possible.

2. [Cheat Sheets](https://www.cheatography.com/tag/programming/)

Cheat sheets can be a good way to quickly look up information or just learn some new techniques or refresh your memory. I think they can be a good overview of techniques, but they can be hard to read and learn from.

3. [Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
(Python 3 example)

The documentation for a programming language (or library) is an invaluable resource. Often you can learn not only specific aspects of standard - or third party - libraries, but you can also come to understand the philosophy and guidelines that dictate the structure of the language or library you're trying to learn. 

### Courses

1. [MITx 6.00.1x and 6.00.2x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11)

This two course sequence from MIT is a good introduction to programming in general. Even if you have experience programming, the college-level depth will likely push you and help you improve as a programmer. The first course assumes no knowledge of programming, but does require some mathematical maturity (at the high school level). You can also pay to get a certificate upon completing the course. Both courses teach Python. Personally, I did the second course in the series and found it very managable, but I came in with a lot of Python programming experience prior to taking it. Some may find the courses difficult. 

2. [Harvard's CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)

CS50, the in-person version of CS50x, is Harvard's largest class. The course covers a lot of good CS fundamentals and has a series of challenging problem sets. Be aware of the heavy time commitment. Like the MITx courses, you can also pay for a certificate.

3. [edX](https://www.edx.org/)

EdX has a number of other courses in addition to the two listed above. There are a great many in data science, programming languages, and algorithms for you to check out.

4. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)

Similar to edX, Coursera has high quality courses. However, the business model is a little different. In order to earn certificates and get grades, you need to pay a subscription fee for each course on a monthly basis. The faster you finish the less you pay! See the Data Science section for some popular Coursera courses.

### Books

1. [Think Series](http://greenteapress.com/wp/)

Allen Downey is a professor at Olin College. He has produced a number of programming books on various subjects, such as Python, Bayesian statistics, and Java. I used his Think Python book as a part of my SISP and I really enjoyed the variety of the exercises. The information was fairly well put together and I'd recommend you take a look at his books.

2. [The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)

The C Programming Language is a seminal text in computer science that covers all aspects of the C language and it's written by when of the creators of C. I haven't got around to reading it yet, but I would like to someday as it's considered a foundational text.

3. [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms)

I also have not read this book, but the illustrations and unique style piqued my interest. Those who liked graphical interpretations and content that won't put you to sleep might like this book about algorithms.

4. [Algorithms](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)

This text covers a variety of algorithms and related topics. The programs are written in Java and are efficient and concise. I used this book in my algorithms class at WPI and found it useful.

## Data Science and Machine Learning

### Videos and Video Series

1. [ArXiv Insights](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=arxiv+insights)

Outstanding videos covering various topics in deep learning and robotics. The videos go over both the basics and cutting-edge papers in deep learning, with a particular focus on reinforcement learning.

2. [Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/user/keeroyz)

Great, quick summaries of new papers in machine learning, with equally good graphics.

3. [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)

A catch-all channel for math and science topics, with some of the best mathematical visualizations and intuitive explanations I've found yet. In partiuclar interest is his video series on [neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk).

### Courses

1. [Stanford 231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus)

The definitive course on deep computer vision. This course covers neural networks, convolutions, state-of-the-art architectures, and much more. The quality of Stanford CS courses is phenomenal. Also be sure to look at the student projects, many of which are fascinating in their own right. The assignments are also published alongside the slides, so you can try them yourself.

2. [MIT 6.S099](https://agi.mit.edu/)

An overview series of lectures on the future of artificial intelligence. The lectures are great, high-level thinking and worth the watch, but those looking for an in-depth class on producing AI and writing algorithms should look elsewhere (such as [MIT 6.S191](http://introtodeeplearning.com/); I would recommend the Stanford courses over this one however)

3. [CMU Deep Learning](http://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/)

Lecture videos and slides from CMU's course on deep learning. Video quality isn't great, but the slides are solid. Assignments do not seem to available to the public, unfortunately.

4. [Deep Learning from deeplearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

A practical course with numerous short lectures interspersed with programming assignments. Taught by Andrew Ng, one of the biggest names in deep learning. Teaches TensorFlow and covers mathematical topics at the same level as a university course. Note that graded assignments are not free.

5. [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai/index.html)

A top-down course that teaches you how to hit the ground running with deep learning, and then gets down to the details over time. Good for those that prefer to start using the state-of-the-art right away, and then learn the details. Taught by Jeremy Howard, the top competitor on Kaggle, a top competition site for data science.

6. [Applied Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)

A highly rated course about data science from UMich. Uses Python. Like the deeplearning.ai course, you must pay for graded assignments and a certificate.

Personally, I would recommend the Stanford course and fast.ai, because both are free and very high quality. Also check out some of the links in the general section for other topics. There are tons of great resources online for just about everything in computer science.

### Books

1. [Hands on Machine Learning](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do)

This book covers machine learning from the beginning, teaching both Scikit-learn and TensorFlow. The book has a good balance between practicality and mathematical depth. I used this book during my SISP and I plan on returning to it as a reference in the future.

2. [Deep Learning with Keras](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python)

A book about deep learning from Francis Chollet, the creator of Keras, a widely used deep learning framework. 

3. [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387848570)

A largely theoretical book covering various aspects of statistical learning and computation. There is also a version that covers the R programming language.

### Misc

1. [ML Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/)

A good place for sharing stories, finding new papers, and discussing general machine learning topics.

2. [R/*insertlanguagehere*/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/)(Python example)

Same as above, but many programming langauges have their own subreddit where you can discuss with others and ask questions.

3. [Medium](https://medium.com/)

Medium is a micro-blogging site with a mountain of software developers who often share their advice and wisdom.

4. [Researchers](https://twitter.com/reshamas/lists/notable-data-scientists/members)

Following researchers in your area of interest can really help push your knowledge and give you insights into the bleeding-edge of computer science. I've linked a list (linked lists anyone?) of notable data scientists (not created by me). 

## Contributing to FOSS

The Free and Open Source (FOSS) Movement is based around the democratization of software and has led to amazing developments, such as the creation of Linux and other Unix-based operating systems. Open source software is available for anyone to view the source code, hence the name. Writing code for an open source project gives you an opportunity to not only give back to the libraries which you use, but it also gives you an opportunity to create professional code, undergo code review, and have other people use your code.

Contributing to open source for the first time is challenging, but there are some good places to look:

1. [Awesome First PR Opportunities](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners)

Great resource for different open source projects that welcome first-timers. Listed by programming langauge.

2. [Contributing Guide](https://www.developer.com/open/how-to-start-contributing-to-open-source.html)

A step by step guide for contributing for the first time. 

3. [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

This website is built for first timers, and contains a number of resources to help you find a project and get started.

These resources are starting points; make sure to read the documentation for each project and see how they want contributions handled. Most larger projects have their own websites and their repositories contain a Contributing.md (or similiar) file that outlines how contributions should be made. 

## Advice

Pursue projects that interest and ones that will help you become a better programmer. Make things that you're proud of and want to show off because of how hard you worked on them; you will find that the motivation will always be there. Finally, don't be afraid to jump into the deep end. If you see something you want to make, but it looks complicated, just go for it. Remember, Stack Overflow is your friend.
