# Learning Resources

This repository contains a number of resources for learning different topics in computer science. In particular, you will find resources on machine learning and how to contribute to open source projects, which formed a large part of my [Senior Independent Study Project](https://github.com/ndalton12/Python-Learning).

## General Computer Science Topics

Learning a new programming language or computer science topic can seem daunting at first, but there are numerous courses, books, and cheat-sheets available online to help you learn. The two best ways for me to learn were to read books, which demand your attention, and to actually just work on exercises. I also took an online course which relied on lecture videos, which provided a different learning experience, one that you may prefer.

Here are some links to get you started:

#### Quick References

1.  [Learn X in Y](https://learnxinyminutes.com/)

Learn X in Y is a website for learning different programming languages (and even a few CS topics) in a short timeframe. The languages are presented directly as code, with increasingly complex topics. This website is especially good if you are already comfortable with programming, but want to dive into a new language as quick as possible.

2. [Cheat Sheets](https://www.cheatography.com/tag/programming/)

Cheat sheets can be a good way to quickly look up information or just learn some new techniques or refresh your memory. I think they can be a good overview of techniques, but they can be hard to read and learn from.

3. Documentation

The documentation for a programming language (or library) is an invaluable resource. Often you can learn not only specific aspects of standard - or third party - libraries, but you can also come to understand the philosophy and guidelines that dictate the structure of the language or library you're trying to learn. 

### Courses

1. [MITx 6.00.1x and 6.00.2x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11)

This two course sequence from MIT is a good introduction to programming in general. Even if you have experience programming, the college-level depth will likely push you and help you improve as a programmer. The first course assumes no knowledge of programming, but does require some mathematical maturity (at the high school level). You can also pay to get a certificate upon completing the course. Both courses teach Python. Personally, I did the second course in the series and found it very managable, but I came in with a lot of Python programming experience prior to taking it. Some may find the courses difficult. 

2. [Harvard's CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)

CS50, the in-person version of CS50x, is Harvard's largest class. The course covers a lot of good CS fundamentals and has a series of challenging problem sets. Be aware of the heavy time commitment. Like the MITx courses, you can also pay for a certificate.

## Contributing to FOSS

The Free and Open Source (FOSS) Movement is based around the democratization of software and has led to amazing developments, such as the creation of Linux and other Unix-based operating systems. Open source software is available for anyone to view the source code, hence the name. Writing code for an open source project gives you an opportunity to not only give back to the libraries which you use, but it also gives you an opportunity to create professional code, undergo code review, and have other people use your code.

Contributing to open source for the first time is challenging, but there are some good places to look:

1. [Awesome First PR Opportunities](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners)

Great resource for different open source projects that welcome first-timers. Listed by programming langauge.

2. [Contributing Guide](https://www.developer.com/open/how-to-start-contributing-to-open-source.html)

A step by step guide for contributing for the first time. 

3. [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

This website is built for first timers, and contains a number of resources to help you find a project and get started.

These resources are starting points; make sure to read the documentation for each project and see how they want contributions handled. Most larger projects have their own websites and their repositories contain a Contributing.md (or similiar) file that outlines how contributions should be made. 

## Advice

Pursue projects that interest and ones that will help you become a better programmer. Make things that you're proud of and want to show off because of how hard you worked on them; you will find that the motivation will always be there. Finally, don't be afraid to jump into the deep end. If you see something you want to make, but it looks complicated, just go for it. Remember, Stack Overflow is your friend.
