# Learning Resources

This repository contains a number of resources for learning different topics in computer science. In particular, you will find resources on machine learning and how to contribute to open source projects, which formed a large part of my [Senior Independent Study Project] (https://github.com/ndalton12/Python-Learning).

### Learning New CS Topics

Learning a new programming language or computer science topic can seem daunting at first, but there are numerous courses, books, and cheat-sheets available online to help you learn. The two best ways for me to learn were to read books, which demand your attention, and to actually just work on exercises. I also took an online course which relied on lecture videos, which provide a different learning experience that you may prefer.

Here are some links to get you started:

#### Quick References

1.  [Learn X in Y](https://learnxinyminutes.com/)

Learn X in Y is a website for learning different programming languages (and even a few CS topics) in a short timeframe. The languages are presented directly as code, with increasingly complex topics. This website is especially good if you are already comfortable with programming, but want to dive into a new language as quick as possible.

2. [Cheat Sheets](https://www.cheatography.com/tag/programming/)

Cheat sheets can be a good way to quickly look up information or just learn some new techniques or refresh your memory. I think they can be a good overview of techniques, but they can be hard to read and learn from.

3. Documentation

The documentation for a programming language (or library) is an invaluable resource. Often you can learn not only specific aspects of standard - or third party - libraries, but you can also come to understand the philosophy and guidelines that dictate the structure of the language or library you're trying to learn. 

### Courses

1. [MITx 6.00.1x and 6.00.2x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11)

This two course sequence from MIT is a good introduction to programming in general. Even if you have experience programming, the college-level depth will likely push you and help you improve as a programmer. The first course assumes no knowledge of programming, but does require some mathematical maturity (at the high school level). You can also pay to get a certificate upon completing the course. Both courses teach Python. Personally, I did the second course in the series and found it very managable, but I came in with a lot of Python programming experience prior to taking it. Some may find the courses difficult. 

2. **[Harvard's CS50x] (https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)

CS50, the in-person version of CS50x, is Harvard's largest class. The course covers a lot of good CS fundamentals and has a series of challenging problem sets. Be aware of the heavy time commitment. Like the MITx courses, you can also pay for a certificate.
